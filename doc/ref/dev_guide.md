# Developer guide

This page contains useful commands and tips on how to develop on the Mocha repository.
It collects both design, software and verification instructions.

## Quick start from release

Firstly download all the artefacts from a particular [release](https://github.com/lowRISC/mocha/releases).
Then follow the following steps to test on FPGA:

1. Install dependencies:
    - OpenFPGALoader, for example: `apt install openfpgaloader`
    - Screen, for example: `apt install screen`
2. Connect your Genesys 2 board with the POWER, UART and JTAG. Make sure to turn on the board using SW8.
3. Configure udev rules:
    ```sh
    cp 99-openfpgaloader.rules /etc/udev/rules.d/99-openfpgaloader.rules
    udevadm control --reload-rules
    udevadm trigger
    usermod -a $USER -G plugdev
    ```
4. Program the downloaded bitstream:
    ```sh
    openFPGALoader -b genesys2 lowrisc_mocha_chip_mocha_genesys2_0.bit
    ```
5. Look at UART output:
    ```sh
    screen $(ls /dev/serial/by-id/usb-FTDI_FT232R_USB_UART_*-port0) 1000000
    ```
    You should press the RESET button on the Genesys 2 board (BTN1) to see bootloader message "Boot ROM!". To exit screen press `ctrl`-`a` then `k` and confirm with `y`.

In simulation you can do the following:
1. Make the simulator executable and run the UART smoke test by running the following command:
    ```sh
    chmod +x Vtop_chip_verilator
    ./Vtop_chip_verilator -E hello_world_verilator
    ```
2. Check the UART output:
    ```sh
    cat uart0.log
    ```
    Which should contain content including "Hello CHERI Mocha!"

Programming new software over SPI is also possible using the boot ROM. Here are the steps to run the hello world example:
1. Extract the example software:
    ```sh
    tar -xzvf examples.tar.gz
    ```
2. Open up a screen terminal in parallel:
    ```sh
    screen $(ls /dev/serial/by-id/usb-FTDI_FT232R_USB_UART_*-port0) 1000000
    ```
3. In another terminal program the SPI (note you must run this command twice and it is expected that the second run reports "Fail":
    ```sh
    openFPGALoader --spi --offset 0x4000 --write-flash release/hello_world.bin
    openFPGALoader --spi --offset 0x4000 --write-flash release/hello_world.bin
    ```
    In the terminal where you opened screen you should see the following output:
    ```

    Boot ROM!

    First reset
    Jumping to: 0x%0x
    Hello CHERI Mocha!
    timer 100us
    timer 100us
    timer 100us
    timer 100us
    ```

## Setup Python virtual environment

### Using uv on macOS and Linux

```sh
# Install uv
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

# Create the virtual environment.
uv venv
uv sync --all-extras

# Enter the environment (do it every time).
source .venv/bin/activate
```

### Using Nix or NixOS

```sh
nix develop
```

Alternatively if you are using `direnv` then this can be automated by enabling `direnv`.

```sh
direnv allow .
```

When entering the directory from then on you will automatically enter the dev shell.
Changing directory outside the repository root will deactivate the dev shell for you.

## Software

### Build

Software binaries are built using CMake.

```sh
# Setup the buildsystem.
cmake -B build/sw -S sw
# Build the software.
cmake --build build/sw -j $(nproc)
```

### Code Quality

For software written in C, `clang-format` and `clang-tidy` are used format and lint the code. Wrapper scripts to run these on all C files in the project are provided for convenience.

To format and lint, run:
```sh
# Format all C files.
util/clang_format.py
# Lint all C files.
util/clang_tidy.py
```

## Simulation

We use Verilator to simulate our hardware design and use FuseSoC as a build system:
```sh
# Build simulator.
fusesoc --cores-root=. run --target=sim --tool=verilator --setup --build lowrisc:mocha:top_chip_verilator
# Run simulator.
build/lowrisc_mocha_top_chip_verilator_0/sim-verilator/Vtop_chip_verilator -E build/sw/device/examples/hello_world_verilator
```

One specific feature of our simulator is that you can exit the simulation by using the following magic string:
`Safe to exit simulator.\xd8\xaf\xfb\xa0\xc7\xe1\xa9\xd7`


To run the verilator tests, first build the software, then run:
```sh
ctest --test-dir build/sw -R sim_verilator
```

## FPGA

### OpenFPGALoader

One way to program your FPGA is to use openFPGALoader.
In Linux you must allow openFPGALoader to access your USB device.
First copy the example rules file in this repository and execute some commands for the rules to take effect:
```sh
cp util/99-openfpgaloader.rules /etc/udev/rules.d/99-openfpgaloader.rules
sudo udevadm control --reload-rules
sudo udevadm trigger
sudo usermod -a $USER -G plugdev
```

### Build bitstream

Make sure that Vivado is on your path, then run:
```sh
fusesoc --cores-root=. run --target=synth --setup --build lowrisc:mocha:chip_mocha_genesys2 --BootRomInitFile=$PWD/build/sw/device/examples/hello_world.vmem
```

### Test on Genesys2

Connect to the "UART" and "JTAG" USB ports on the Genesys2 board.

Open a UART terminal with 1Mbps baud rate:
```sh
screen /dev/ttyUSB0 1000000
```
You may have to change the ttyUSB number.

Then load the bitstream onto Genesys 2:
```sh
openFPGALoader -b genesys2 build/lowrisc_mocha_chip_mocha_genesys2_0/synth-vivado/lowrisc_mocha_chip_mocha_genesys2_0.bit
```

## Verification

To run block-level verification you can use the following command:
```sh
dvsim hw/vendor/lowrisc_ip/ip/uart/dv/uart_sim_cfg.hjson -i uart_smoke -r 1 --tool xcelium
```

To run block-level formal verification you can use the following command:
```sh
dvsim hw/top_chip/formal/top_chip_fpv_ip_cfgs.hjson --select-cfgs rv_plic_fpv
```

To run top-level verification you can use the following command:
```sh
dvsim hw/top_chip/dv/mocha_sim_cfgs.hjson --tool xcelium
```
