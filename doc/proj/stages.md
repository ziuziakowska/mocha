# Design and verification stages

In CHERI Mocha we have stages to measure the design and verification progress.
Moving from one stage to another requires a formal checklist and sign-off.
The design stages are inspired by [OpenTitan's development stages](https://opentitan.org/book/doc/project_governance/development_stages.html).
The checklists are inspired by [OpenTitan's checklists](https://opentitan.org/book/doc/project_governance/checklist/index.html).
Slight modification to the stages and checklists were made to meet the requirements for the COSMIC project.

## Sign-off procedure

To advance a block from one stage to the next you must open a pull request with the checklist in a Markdown file called `doc/proj/BLOCK.md`, where `BLOCK` is replaced by the block's name.
A [checklist template](checklist_template.md) is provided as a starting point.
This pull request must be approved by at least three people, one of whom should ideally be someone who has not been involved in the design and the verification of the block.
It should also update [the table](#current-status) documenting the current status of each block.

## Design stages

These are the stages each block goes through.

| **Stage** | **Name** | **Definition** |
|-----------|----------|----------------|
| D0  | Initial Work | RTL being developed, not functional. |
| D1  | Functional | <ul> <li> Feature set finalized, spec complete </li> <li> CSRs identified; RTL/DV/SW collateral generated </li> <li> SW interface automation completed </li> <li> Clock(s) and reset(s) connected to all sub modules </li> <li> Lint run setup </li> </ul> |
| D2  | Feature Complete | <ul> <li> All features implemented </li> <li> Feature frozen </li> </ul> |
| D2S | Security Countermeasures Complete | In OpenTitan this stage is used to verify that all security countermeasures implemented. In Mocha we don't currently plan to use this stage. |
| D3  | Design Complete | <ul> <li> Lint/CDC clean, waivers reviewed </li> <li> Design optimisation for power and/or performance complete </li> </ul> |

### D1 design sign-off checklist

Checklists for signing off a block at D1.

| **Item name** | **Description** |
|---------------|-----------------|
| SPEC_COMPLETED | Specification is 90% complete. |
| CSR_DEFINED | Registers defined for the primary programming model. |
| CLKRST_CONNECTED | Clock and reset connected to all submodules. |
| IP_TOP | There is an IP top that can be included in the top design. |
| IP_INSTANTIABLE | The IP compiles and elaborates without errors. |
| PHYSICAL_MACROS_DEFINED_80 | Physical macros for memories and analogue components are defined and roughly 80% accurate. |
| FUNC_IMPLEMENTED | The main functional path is implemented to allow basic testing. |
| ASSERT_KNOWN_ADDED | Assert that all outputs of the blocks are “known.” |
| LINT_SETUP | Lint flow is set up, but it is acceptable to have warnings at this point. |

## Verification stages

These are the verification stages each block goes through.
Some items are marked as only for *simulation* or only for *formal* depending on which approaches are used in the verification process.
